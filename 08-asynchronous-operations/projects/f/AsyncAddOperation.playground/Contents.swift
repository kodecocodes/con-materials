 AsyncSumOperation simply adds two numbers together asynchronously and assigns the result. It sleeps for two seconds just so that you can
 see the random ordering of the operation.  Nothing guarantees that an operation will complete in the order it was added.

 - important:
 Notice that `self.state` is being set to `.finished`. What would happen if you left this line out?
